## code for KDE prediction models
## Nicholas Reich
## 7 October 2016
## 15 June 2017 - updated for cdcFlu20172018 package 

## General strategy

## ESTIMATION
## write a function 
##   inputs: a dataset
##   outputs: a list of KDE fits, one for each target
## iterate function across all regions and years to create a set of fits 
##    to all data to up the current year (not LOSO)
## 
## notes by target:
##     weekly incidence: use observations from target week +/- 1 week 
##     peak incidence: truncate above previous observations?
##     onset and peak week: discrete, but use continuous KDEs and round
##     onset week: there is a none category, consider including a point-mass based on past seasons not above baseline
##     
## PREDICTION
## write a predict function 
##   input: a fitted object from above 
##   input: a time at which to make predictions for (data not needed!)
##   input: n_sims
##   output: data_frame in format as others, specifying predictive distribution
## iterate across regions, left-out years to create predictions
##
