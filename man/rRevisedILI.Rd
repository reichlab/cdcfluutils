\title{sample revised ILI trajectories}
\usage{
rRevisedILI(n, observed_inc, epiweek_idx, region, season,
  season_start_epiweek = 40, add_nowcast = FALSE, min_value = 0.05,
  return_sampled_id = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of revised trajectories to sample}

\item{observed_inc}{observed incidence so far this season, starting at EW40 and going to the most recent report}

\item{epiweek_idx}{most recent epidemic week (equals 40 + length(observed_inc) - # weeks in season)}

\item{region}{region trajectory was made from}

\item{season}{current season in 20xx/20xx+1 format}

\item{add_nowcast}{logical; add nowcast based on delphi epicast?}

\item{min_value}{minimum value for revised wILI; any lower values are truncated here.}

\item{return_sampled_id}{logical; return a data frame with identifiers of sampled region, season, and epiweek?}
}
\value{
n by length(observed_inc) matrix of samples for possible revised ili.
