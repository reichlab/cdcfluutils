\usage{
get_log_scores_via_trajectory_simulation(all_seasons_left_out,
  analysis_time_season, first_analysis_time_season_week = 10,
  last_analysis_time_season_week = 41, region, prediction_target_var,

}
\arguments{
\item{all_seasons_left_out}{character vector of seasons that were in the
training period, in the format "2000/2001"}

\item{analysis_time_season}{character vector of length 1 specifying the
season to obtain predictions for, in the format "2000/2001"}

\item{first_analysis_time_season_week}{integer specifying the first week of
the season in which to make predictions, using all data up to and
including that week to make predictions for each following week in the
season}

\item{last_analysis_time_season_week}{integer specifying the last week of
the season in which to make predictions, using all data up to and including
that week to make predictions for each following week in the season}

\item{region}{string specifying the region to use, in the format "X" or
"Region k" where k in {1, ..., 10}}

\item{prediction_target_var}{string specifying the name of the variable in
data for which we want to make predictions}

\item{incidence_bins}{a data frame with variables lower and upper defining
lower and upper endpoints to use in binning incidence}

\item{incidence_bin_names}{a character vector with a name for each incidence
bin}

\item{n_trajectory_sims}{integer number of trajectories to simulate}

\item{simulate_trajectories_function}{a function to call to simulate
incidence trajectories.  It will be called with the following arguments:
  * n_sims = number of trajectories to simulate
  * max_prediction_horizon = number of following weeks to simulate
  * data = all available data to use in doing simulation, up to and
      including the analysis time
  * region = region
  * analysis_time_season = analysis_time_season
  * analysis_time_season_week = week of the season at which we are making
      the predictions
  * params = simulate_trajectories_params; additional user-provided
      parameters}

\item{simulate_trajectories_params}{optional additional parameters to pass
to simulate_trajectories_function}

\item{model_name}{name of model, stored in the results data frame}

\item{prediction_save_path}{path to directory where results will be saved}
}

\description{
for a given season using a predictive method that works by simulating
trajectories of incidence in each remaining week of the season.  Results are
stored in a data frame, saved in a .rds file with a name like
"model_name-region-season-loso-predictions.rds"
Results have columns indicating the analysis time season and season week,
model name, log scores for each prediction target, the "log score" used
in the competition (adding probabilities from adjacent bins) for each
prediction target, as well as the log of the probability assigned to each
bin.
