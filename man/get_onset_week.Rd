\title{Utility function to compute onset week based on a trajectory of incidence values}
\usage{
get_onset_week(incidence_trajectory, baseline, onset_length,
  first_season_week = 31, weeks_in_first_season_year)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence_trajectory}{a numeric vector with incidence for each time
point in a season}

\item{baseline}{the threshold that incidence must cross to count as an onset}

\item{onset_length}{number of consecutive time points that incidence must
exceed the baseline threshold in order to count as the season onset}

\item{first_season_week}{number of weeks in year corresponding to the first
week in the season.  For example, our code takes this value to be 31:
a new influenza season starts on the 31st week of each year.}

\item{weeks_in_first_season_year}{How many MMWR weeks are in the first year
of the season?  For example, in the 2000/2001 season, the first year is
2000.  There were 52 MMWR weeks in 2000.}
}
\value{
the smallest index i such that every entry of
  incidence_trajectory[seq(from = i, length = onset_length)]
  is >= baseline, if such an index exists.
  Otherwise, the character vector "none"
}
