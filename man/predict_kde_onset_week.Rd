\usage{
predict_kde_onset_week(fm, n_sim)
}
\arguments{
\item{fm}{output from fit_kde_onset_week()}

\item{n_sim}{number of draws from predictive distribution to return}
}
\value{
vector of 53 probabilities representing the predictive distribution of onset week, 
        in bins representing season week 1 through 52 (or EW31 through EW30 -- or EW29 if a 53 week year) 
        with the final entry representing the probability of no onset
